^ yeah I did that by myself in procreate, was harder than I thought it would be, but I got it!

Man you're now one year close to not being a teenager. It's absolutely awe-inspiring that we met we when we were 9, and now we've basically known each other for 10 years?? Well, technically, this coming spring will mark out 10 year. That's so wild.

In any case, you just finished a whole year at Caltech. I know that it had a lot of it's ups and downs, but DAMN BOI you absolutely demolished it. Like first of all, you made friends. You Have Friends. Remember how worried/complacent you were about just not having people to hang out with? And then look at you, NAILED IT. They all seem like absolutely wonderful people, and I will meet them one day and it will be gorgeous.

Second of all, you actually destroyed the classes. Like damn. You worked So hard in math and did great, chem didn't kill you even though it was fucking trying, you got through physics well enough to not have to complain to me about it, meaning that it was actually pretty damn good, and your hums classes went well, and just man.

AND YOU GOT AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY. Like huh????? Babe????? As you go through and learn stuff please tell me what you do and what you learn, I'm deathly curious, legitly.
