_Yeah I did that by myself in procreate~ T'was harder than I thought it would be, but I got it!_

Man you're now one year close to not being a teenager. It's absolutely awe-inspiring that we met we when we were 9, and now we've basically known each other for 10 years?? Well, technically, this coming spring will mark out 10 year. That's so wild.

In any case, you just finished a whole year at Caltech. I know that it had a lot of it's ups and downs, but DAMN BOI you absolutely demolished it. Like first of all, you made friends. You Have Friends. Remember how worried/complacent you were about just not having people to hang out with? And then look at you, NAILED IT. They all seem like absolutely wonderful people, and I will meet them one day and it will be gorgeous.

Second of all, you actually destroyed the classes. Like damn. You worked So hard in math and did great, chem didn't kill you even though it was fucking trying, you got through physics well enough to not have to complain to me about it, meaning that it was actually pretty damn good, and your hums classes went well, and just man.

AND YOU GOT AN ABSOLUTELY AMAZING RESEARCH OPPORTUNITY. Like huh????? Babe????? As you go through and learn stuff please tell me what you do and what you learn, I'm deathly curious, legitly. 

So, the biggest thing I would like you to know is that I am so so proud of you for your progress, for your character development, for your introspection, for your style, for your Teeth, for your Eyes, everything. I am so very proud of you my friend, and I am very proud to be your friend.

_From this..._

_we really like to do the elbow holding thing in pictures huh, I'm not complaining_

At this point, you should have gotten an email from Steam with something like "Hat in Time" gift or something like that. I hope you enjoy the base game and all the DLC's :D I heard the Nyakuza Metro is an absolute must have, and is gorgeous, so you can enjoy that to the fullest with your BADASS computer that can actually handle games with intense graphics. Not entirely jealous, not entirely, but definitely at least a little jealous.

And when you come back for a bit in August, I will take you out to like Panera or some other food place so we can enjoy some nice food while celebrating your existance, albeit belatedly.

YOU'RE GREAT, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HAVE A SUPER WONDERFUL DAY WHERE YOU RELAX SOME AND EAT SOME GOOD FOOD AND ENJOY GOOD WEATHER HOPEFULLY!!!!!!
